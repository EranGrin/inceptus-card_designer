The Card / Label Designer module is a unique module that will provide a user with the possibility to Easily design a Label or Card that could then be dynamically integrated with data records of any other module.
The big advantage of this module is the fact that we can add dynamic variables that are already part of the Odoo ERP and therefore a user can create a template and on top of it dynamic variables such as a barcode of the Gift Card Code, or image of an employee from the employee HR module
